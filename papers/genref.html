# General Education Reflection
My General Education courses have helped me grow as an engineer by expanding my perspective when approaching problems. 
Greek and Roman Mythology taught me to analyze complex narratives and human motivations. This skill translates directly to
anticipating user needs and designing solutions that account for various human behaviors. Russia Today showed me how 
political and economic factors shape technological development, emphasizing that engineering solutions must fit within 
their social, cultural, and economic contexts. This was particularly clear when we studied Soviet Russia, where oppressive 
policies often stifled innovation. That example made me consider how external pressures and constraints can influence both
the design process and the feasibility of a solution.
  Courses in ethics, communication, and the humanities reinforced the importance of responsibility, teamwork, and clear 
communication in engineering. They showed me that engineering is not just about finding effective solutions, but also 
about understanding how those solutions affect people and society. My general education experience has strengthened my 
ability to innovate and think carefully about how a solution can be shaped by its environment. These courses have shown me
the value of considering social impact, sustainability, and practical feasibility alongside technical performance.
