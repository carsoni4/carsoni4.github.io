# Career Objectives

My career objective is to build a strong foundation in cybersecurity by gaining experience in threat analysis, 
system defense, security policy, and the interworkings of hardware. Over time, I would like to grow into a role
where I can not only protect networks and data but also contribute to developing better security strategies and adapt
to evolving threats. I think developing software to work in stride with my Cyber Security skills is something that
I would like to do as well as I like the endless creativity in creating software. I think working on large scale 
projects is something I have also come to enjoy, while college is limited by semesters I have enjoyed all of the
larger projects I have gotten to work on. I think this would translate to being able to work on something for a
years at a time, becoming really familiar with the code base, and how the project ties together. Overall I think 
the most important goals I have are to enjoy the team I work with, and to work on projects that are going to be
helpful to a lot of people.
