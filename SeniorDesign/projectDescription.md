title: COMS 3090 Project Description
---

My group was tasked with creating a 32 bit MIPS capable Pipelined, Multi-Cycle, Single Cycle CPU's in VHDL. This was
one of the most difficult classes I have taken at Iowa State, but it was the class I learned the most in. Debugging
the processor in the class was one of the most infuriating, yet satisfying processes. There were multiple times that
I would be failing over 50 tests on my CPU and I would find a single register that had been incorrectly assigned a value
and it would fix almost all of them. 
I would say the biggest takeaway from this class was the general understanding of how different types of CPU's work.
While modern CPU's are much more complex, the class allowed me to see what goes into the development of this technology 
and made me respect how far we have advanced on a hardware level.

    <p>
    While my team has not decided on a frontend solution yet I have put my hat in the ring for sveltejs (web) and
    svelte native (app). We are not 100% sure that an app is going to be plausible to develop on top of the web environment,
    but I think that using svelte js and native for the frameworks will make it a consistent development experience.

    <p>
    Below is an example of the .NET WEB API, which is what we are using for the backend of the project. While we 
    have not started actual backend development below is an example of a simple http request handler for recieving temperature
    information from the arduino.
