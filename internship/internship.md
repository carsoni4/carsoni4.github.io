title: Internship Experience at Weiler Products
---

At Weiler Products I have been fortunate to gain experience across many areas of IT. I created programs in the .NET Framework for SQL data handling, developed WPF applications for managing manufacturing items, and built a manufacturing change form and notification system using Power Automate and PowerApps. I also performed hardware repair, set up PCs, and created a custom Windows 11 image with company branding and optimized settings by removing unnecessary Microsoft apps. Through these projects I strengthened my technical skills in software development, database integration, workflow automation, and system deployment, as well as soft skills in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and collaboration.
