title: COMS 3090 Project Description

My group was tasked with creating a 32 bit MIPS capable Pipelined, Multi-Cycle, Single Cycle CPU's in VHDL. This was
one of the most difficult classes I have taken at Iowa State, but it was the class I learned the most in. Debugging
the processor in the class was one of the most infuriating, yet satisfying processes. There were multiple times that
I would be failing over 50 tests on my CPU and I would find a single register that had been incorrectly assigned a value
and it would fix almost all of them. 
I would say the biggest takeaway from this class was the general understanding of how different types of CPU's work.
While modern CPU's are much more complex, the class allowed me to see what goes into the development of this technology 
and made me respect how far we have advanced on a hardware level.
